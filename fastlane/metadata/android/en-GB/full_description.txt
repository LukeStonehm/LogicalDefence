Prepare to battle against the sophists of the world with this beautiful app.

Steel yourselves, and begin to defend your mind from the language used against you by the sophists of the world.

They are many, we are few, but with the Logical Defence app, we now have an extra tool in our box of rationality. 
Use this app to quickly look-up the logical fallacies we face when debating against the irrational. 
Call out those who are logically flawed and help to build a more rational society.

Honesty is the first virtue, so let's be painfully honest towards those who attempt to use language as a form of mental abuse. Never accept a logical fallacy, attack the attacker, and spread logic and reason to those you love.

Ok, enough rambling. This is an app that displays a list of the logical fallacies that haunt every rationalists' mind.

Some features:

- Left drawer that houses categories.
- Share function -> Long press a fallacy to share it.
- Nice about screen.
- Language selection function.

This is a fully open-source project (GNU v2), and the source is hosted on GitHub so feel free to fork me :)
